# Liam Donovan — Mathematics, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning Portfolio

This is my academic and technical portfolio.  
This repository collects work across three major areas:

1. **Applied Data Analysis** — statistical investigations using R and Python  
2. **Mathematical Exposition** — concise papers explaining advanced topics clearly  
3. **Research & Machine Learning Projects** — deeper work involving probability, GAN theory, and classical + modern ML

The goal of this repository is not only to show *code* or *results*, but to demonstrate:
- mathematically grounded reasoning  
- clear explanation of complex ideas  
- pedagogical awareness  
- practical analytical skills  
- the ability to communicate technical results to a variety of audiences

## 1. Data Analysis Projects  
Located in: **`data-analysis/`**

A collection of statistical analyses performed using R and Python.  
These projects emphasize data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and communication through slides and written summaries.

### Included Analyses
- **Climate Change & Natural Disaster Severity**  
  Examines temperature trends in the U.S. (1979–2011) and their correlation with natural disaster frequency and cost.  
  Includes PDF slides and all supporting graphics.

- **Economic Costs of Climate Change (1980–2011)**  
  Investigates the relationship between rising temperatures and U.S. economic losses due to natural disasters.

- **College Basketball Performance Modeling**  
  Builds a regression model to identify which efficiency and defensive metrics best predict team success.

- **Opioid Crisis Mortality Analysis (1999–2020)**  
  An analysis of CDC WONDER mortality data, exploring temporal trends in opioid-related deaths across the United States.

Each project folder includes slides and/or written reports (PDF), along with a short README describing methods, data sources, and skills demonstrated.

## 2. Mathematical Exposition  
Located in: **`math-exposition/`**

Short, self-contained documents aimed at explaining core mathematical ideas with clarity and structure.  
These are not research papers — they’re carefully written explanations designed to be approachable to students while still mathematically correct.

### Current Expositions
- **Gamma Function as an Analytic Extension of the Factorial**  
- **The Laplace Transform from First Principles**  
- **Taylor Series & Why Approximation Works**  
- **Bezout’s Identity, Euclid’s Algorithm, and the Structure of \(\gcd\)**  

Each exposition includes:
- definitions motivated by real observations  
- intuitive explanations  
- algebraic reasoning  
- proofs only after intuition has been built

##  3. Research & Machine Learning Projects  
Located in: **`research-projects/`**

These are more advanced and research-oriented.  
They cover probability, optimization, neural networks, and sequential inference — with both posters and detailed write-ups.

### Included Projects

#### **Spectral Normalization for Generative Models**
- Why Lipschitz constraints matter for GAN stability  
- Wasserstein-1 distance and Kantorovich–Rubinstein duality  
- Power iteration for estimating spectral norms  
- Comparison to weight clipping and gradient penalty  
- Includes both a full write-up and a TikZposter  
:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

#### **Sequential Analysis & Martingales**
- Likelihood ratio martingales  
- Optional stopping / Ville’s inequality  
- Mixture, CGF, and stitched martingales  
- Simulation comparisons using Bernoulli data  
- Includes a detailed pedagogical write-up and conference-style poster  
:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

#### **Image Segmentation via Gaussian Mixture Models**
- EM algorithm derivation  
- RGB vs grayscale segmentation experiments  
- Hard vs soft clustering  
- Discussion of initialization and model limitations  
- Includes full PDF report
