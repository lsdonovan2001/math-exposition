# An Intuitive Approach to Power Series and Taylor Series

This document develops power series and Taylor series from first principles, focusing on intuition and discovery rather than rote memorization.

### 🌱 What This Write-Up Emphasizes
- How polynomials naturally lead to power series  
- Why convergence depends on the radius/interval  
- How the geometric series informs general power series  
- How repeated differentiation isolates coefficients  
- How the Taylor/Maclaurin series arise *organically*  
- Step-by-step examples with minimal formal overhead  
- Natural motivation for common series such as  
  - \( e^x \)  
  - \( \sin(x) \)  
  - \( \cos(x) \)  
  - \( \ln(x) \)

### 🧠 Pedagogical Approach

The tone is teaching-focused:  
- Little reliance on formal theorems or pre-existing machinery  
- Heavy use of pattern recognition  
- “Rewrite and see what happens” style reasoning  
- Plenty of intermediate steps  
- Equations justified verbally  
- Attempts to show *how one would have invented the idea*

This mirrors the teaching philosophy I use with students: build intuition first, formalize afterward.

### 🎯 Why This Matters

Taylor series are foundational in:
- differential equations  
- numerical methods  
- physics modeling  
- machine learning approximations  
- signal analysis  

But students often see only formulas, *not* the logic that produces them.  
This write-up is designed to bridge that gap.
