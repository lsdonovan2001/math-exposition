# Research & Machine Learning Projects

This section contains advanced machine learning and probability projects, each accompanied by a poster and/or paper.  
These works emphasize deeper mathematical reasoning, algorithmic insight, and the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly.

The projects here reflect a blend of:
- research-oriented mathematical maturity  
- ML intuition and implementation  
- probabilistic modeling  
- technical communication through posters and papers  
- conceptual clarity and derivational insight

## Projects

### **1. Spectral Normalization for Generative Models**
**Topics:** Lipschitz continuity, GAN stability, singular values, neural network regularization  

A mathematical and algorithmic examination of spectral normalization as a method to stabilize GAN training.  
Includes an explanation of how weight matrices interact with Lipschitz constraints and why controlling singular values improves generative model behavior.

**Paper:** *Coming Soon*  
**Poster:** *Coming Soon*

### **2. Sequential Martingales and Mixture Methods**
**Topics:** martingales, sequential testing, optional stopping, mixture bounds, concentration  

A research-style overview of sequential martingale techniques used in modern probability and statistics.  
Covers mixture martingales, stitching, sequential likelihood ratios, and the structure behind finite-time bounds.  
The emphasis is conceptual clarity: why these martingales work, how they’re constructed, and what intuition drives their form.

### **3. Image Segmentation via Gaussian Mixture Models**
**Topics:** EM algorithm, clustering, computer vision, density estimation, unsupervised learning  

An undergraduate ML project implementing a Gaussian Mixture Model for image segmentation.  
Covers EM updates, convergence behavior, pixel-level likelihood modeling, and quantitative comparison with alternative segmentation approaches.  
Includes both a full paper and a presentation.

## Purpose of This Section

This folder highlights:
- ability to conduct and communicate research-oriented work  
- comfort with advanced ML concepts and probability theory  
- clarity in mathematical explanation  
- experience producing posters and papers  
- bridging rigorous reasoning with practical ML intuition  

These projects complement the **data-analysis portfolio** (applied analytics) and the **math-exposition portfolio** (teaching/communication).  
Together, they present a complete picture of both analytical depth and communicative clarity.
